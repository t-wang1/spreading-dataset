Here is lots of new blue goo now. New goo, blue goo. Gooey gooey. Blue goo, new goo. Gluey gluey. Gooey goo for chewy chewing. That's what that goo goose is doing. Do you choose to chew goo too, sir? If sir you sir choose to chew sir with the goo goose chew sir, do, sir. Mr. Fox, sir, I won't do it. I can't say it. I won't chew it. Very well, sir. Step this way. We'll find another game to play.

Mr. Knox now, come now, come now. You don't have to be so dumb now. Try to say this, Mr. Knox, please. Through three cheese trees, three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, Freezy Breeze blew. Freezy Breeze made these three trees freeze. Freezy Trees made these cheese trees freeze. That's what made these three free fleas sneeze. Stop it! Stop it! That's enough, sir. I can't say such silly stuff, sir. Very well then, Mr. Knox, sir. Let's have a little talk about Tweedle Beetles. What do you know about Tweedle Beetles? Well... And when they battle in a puddle, it's a Tweedle Beetle puddle battle. And when Tweedle Beetles battle with paddles in a puddle, they call it a Tweedle Beetle puddle paddle battle. And when beetles battle beetles in a puddle paddle battle, and the beetle battle puddle is a puddle in a bottle, they call this a Tweedle Beetle bottle puddle paddle battle muddle. And when beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles and the bottle's on a poodle and the poodle's eating noodles, they call this a muddle puddle Tweedle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle. And... Now wait a minute, Mr. Socks Fox. When a fox is in a bottle where their Tweedle Beetles battle with their paddles in a puddle on a noodle-eating poodle, this is what they call... A Tweedle Beetle noodle poodle bottled paddled muddled duddled fuddled wuddled Fox and Socks, sir. Fox and Socks, our game is done, sir. Thank you for a lot of fun, sir. Now is your tongue numb?
